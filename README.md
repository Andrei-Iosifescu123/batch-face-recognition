# Face Recognition in a Directory

## Overview

This project provides a Python script to perform face recognition on all images within a specified directory. Using OpenCV, the YuNet face detection model, and pre-trained face recognition models, the script detects and recognizes faces in each image. Recognized faces are logged, and matching images can be copied to a specified directory.

For those moments when you have an entire folder of vacation photos and need to find out if your friendâ€™s face appears in every single one of themâ€”this toolâ€™s got your back ðŸ˜‰.

## Features

- Detect and recognize faces in a directory of images using the YuNet face detection model.
- Logs recognized faces with accuracy scores to a text file.
- Copy images with recognized faces to a specified directory.
- Progress tracking with a visual progress bar using `tqdm`.

## Requirements
```bash
opencv-python
numpy
tqdm
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Andrei-Iosifescu123/batch-face-recognition.git
    cd batch-face-recognition
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
### Arguments
- `--target` or `-t`: Path to the target image containing the face to match against.
- `--query_dir` or `-q`: Directory containing images to search for faces.
- `--model` or `-m`: Path to the face recognition model (default: face_recognition_sface_2021dec.onnx).
- `--backend_target` or `-bt`: Choose the backend-target combination to run the demo. Options include:  
            0: OpenCV + CPU (default)  
            1: CUDA + GPU  
            2: CUDA + GPU (FP16)  
            3: TIM-VX + NPU  
            4: CANN + NPU  
- `--dis_type`: Distance type for face matching (0: cosine, 1: norm_l1; default: 0).
- `--save` or `-s`: Directory to copy images with recognized faces. If not provided, images wonâ€™t be copied.
- `--threshold` or `-th`: Accuracy threshold for recognizing faces (default: 0.6).
- `--logfile` or `-l`: Path to the log file to record recognized faces. If not provided, no log is created.

### Example
The following command will recognize all faces in the `/media/hdd/family_photos` directory matching the face in the image `Emily.jpg`, without saving matching images or outputting to a logfile:
```bash
python3 main.py --target Emily.jpg --query_dir /media/hdd/family_photos
```
